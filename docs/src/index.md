# PressureFieldContact

This module implements the elastic foundation-themed contact model for rigid body dynamics described in [this short video](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1R_q9eIaIBnTLhvTE5U2uzUsbZOM8hdeV).
[This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.11433.pdf) describes the method in greater detail.

This model was originally designed to model contact robotic manipulation tasks, and can model a variety of contacts including non-convex contacts.
Compared to point contact it is accurate and slow.
Compared to FEM it is inaccurate and fast.
